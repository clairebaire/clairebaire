Hi! I'm [Claire](https://lipskey.me). I'm currently a Senior Javascript Software Engineer at [Kin Insurance](https://kin.com). In my spare time, I'm working on [Layla](https://github.com/clairebaire/layla), a photo manager named after my cat built in Electron. It's still early on though, so nothing to see yet. I like music, being snarky, and just overall being unapologetically me. Maybe we'll work together sometime!
